## Visualization Catalog

### 1. Work Mode Distribution (Bar Chart)
**Location:** Overview Tab  
**Chart Type:** Vertical Bar Chart  
**Variables:** Work Mode (x-axis) vs. Employee Count (y-axis)

**Purpose:** Display the distribution of employees across the three work arrangements

**Data Shown:**
- Hybrid: 465 employees (46.1%)
- Office: 334 employees (33.1%)
- Remote: 210 employees (20.8%)

**Key Insight:** Nearly half the workforce operates in hybrid mode, reflecting modern workplace preferences and post-pandemic adaptations.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Hybrid dominance suggests employee preference for flexibility
- Significant office presence indicates continued value of in-person work
- Remote workers represent a substantial minority (1 in 5)

---

### 2. Productivity Score by Work Mode (Box Plot)
**Location:** Charts Tab  
**Chart Type:** Box Plot with Outliers  
**Variables:** Work Mode (x-axis) vs. Productivity Score 0-10 (y-axis)

**Purpose:** Compare productivity distributions across work modes and identify outliers/variations

**Data Shown:**
- Office: Mean = 4.32, Std = 2.73
- Hybrid: Mean = 2.72, Std = 2.67
- Remote: Mean = 1.14, Std = 0.91

**Key Insight:** Office workers demonstrate 37% higher productivity than hybrid and 74% higher than remote workers.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Box height shows variation within each group
- Office mode has highest median and widest range
- Remote work shows tightest clustering (most consistent, but low)
- Outliers indicate exceptional high/low performers in each mode

**Business Implication:** Organizations prioritizing output should maintain office presence or implement specific remote productivity interventions.

### 3. Wellbeing Score by Work Mode (Box Plot)
**Location:** Charts Tab  
**Chart Type:** Box Plot  
**Variables:** Work Mode (x-axis) vs. Wellbeing Score 0-1 (y-axis)

**Purpose:** Compare employee wellbeing distributions across work arrangements

**Data Shown:**
- Remote: Mean = 0.62, Std = 0.20
- Office: Mean = 0.58, Std = 0.16
- Hybrid: Mean = 0.54, Std = 0.18

**Key Insight:** Remote workers report the highest wellbeing, inverting the productivity ranking.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Remote mode delivers 6% higher wellbeing than office
- Hybrid shows lowest wellbeing despite flexibility benefits
- Wellbeing variation is relatively consistent across modes

**Business Implication:** Work-from-home arrangements support work-life balance and employee satisfaction, even if productivity suffers.

---

### 4. Productivity vs. Wellbeing Scatter Plot
**Location:** Correlations Tab  
**Chart Type:** Scatter Plot with Trend Line  
**Variables:** Productivity Score (x-axis) vs. Wellbeing Score (y-axis)

**Purpose:** Examine the relationship between productivity and wellbeing to identify trade-offs or synergies

**Data Shown:**
- Correlation coefficient: 0.069 (weak positive)
- Scatter shows wide distribution with no clear pattern

**Key Insight:** Productivity and wellbeing are essentially independentâ€”high productivity does not predict high wellbeing and vice versa.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Flat trend line indicates minimal relationship
- All four quadrants populated: high-high, high-low, low-high, low-low
- Enables segmentation into employee archetypes

**Business Implication:** Organizations must address productivity and wellbeing separately with distinct interventions.

---

### 5. Department Performance Heatmap
**Location:** Statistics Tab  
**Chart Type:** Heatmap  
**Variables:** Department (rows) vs. Metrics (columns: Productivity, Wellbeing)

**Purpose:** Identify top and bottom performing departments across both key metrics

**Data Shown:**
| Department | Productivity | Wellbeing |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| QA | 3.35 | 0.55 |
| DevOps | 3.14 | 0.56 |
| AI Engineer | 3.01 | 0.53 |
| Support | 3.00 | 0.59 |
| Data Analyst | 2.80 | 0.58 |
| Software Developer | 2.61 | 0.59 |
| Product Manager | 2.59 | 0.56 |

**Key Insight:** Technical execution roles (QA, DevOps) lead in productivity; wellbeing is more consistent across departments.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Color intensity shows relative performance
- QA and DevOps are productivity leaders
- Product Manager and Software Developer lag in productivity
- Wellbeing variation (0.53-0.59) is much smaller than productivity (2.59-3.35)

**Business Implication:** Productivity improvement efforts should target lower-performing departments; wellbeing strategies can be organization-wide.

### 6. Support System Impact (Grouped Bar Chart)
**Location:** Insights Tab  
**Chart Type:** Grouped Bar Chart  
**Variables:** Support Level (x-axis) vs. Productivity/Wellbeing Scores (y-axis)

**Purpose:** Visualize how team support and resource availability affect outcomes

**Data Shown:**

**Team Support:**
- Yes: Productivity 2.97, Wellbeing 0.70
- Sometimes: Productivity 2.53, Wellbeing 0.53
- No: Productivity 3.25, Wellbeing 0.45

**Resources & Tools:**
- Always: Productivity 2.72, Wellbeing 0.69
- Sometimes: Productivity 3.79, Wellbeing 0.54
- Never: Productivity 2.48, Wellbeing 0.44

**Key Insight:** Strong, consistent support increases wellbeing by 56% (0.70 vs. 0.45). Resources also critical for wellbeing.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Side-by-side bars show both metrics simultaneously
- Wellbeing shows clear gradient with support level
- Productivity relationship is less clear (potentially confounded)

**Business Implication:** Investing in support infrastructure delivers measurable wellbeing returns, regardless of work mode.

---

### 7. Experience Level Analysis (Bar Chart)
**Location:** Statistics Tab  
**Chart Type:** Grouped Bar Chart  
**Variables:** Experience Level (x-axis) vs. Productivity/Wellbeing (y-axis)

**Purpose:** Compare performance across career stages

**Data Shown:**
| Experience | Productivity | Wellbeing | Count |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Beginner | 2.90 | 0.57 | 471 |
| Intermediate | 2.97 | 0.57 | 340 |
| Expert | 2.90 | 0.57 | 198 |

**Key Insight:** Experience level has minimal impact on productivity or wellbeing in this dataset.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Bars are nearly identical across experience levels
- Wellbeing is exactly 0.57 for all groups
- Productivity varies by only 2% (2.90-2.97)

**Business Implication:** Experience-based assumptions may be unfounded; all employees require support regardless of tenure.

---

### 8. Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)
**Location:** Correlations Tab  
**Chart Type:** Correlation Heatmap  
**Variables:** All numeric variables (working hours, tasks, projects, productivity, wellbeing)

**Purpose:** Identify relationships between numeric variables to understand drivers of performance

**Data Shown:**
- Productivity vs. Wellbeing: 0.069 (weak)
- [Other correlations based on your specific data]

**Key Insight:** Most variables show weak correlations, suggesting complex, multi-factor causation.

**Interpretation Guide:**
- Color intensity indicates correlation strength
- Diagonal always shows 1.0 (perfect self-correlation)
- Values near 0 indicate independence
- Negative values show inverse relationships

**Business Implication:** Simple, single-factor interventions unlikely to drive major improvements; holistic strategies needed.

## Visualization Best Practices Used

### 1. Color Coding
- **Consistent palette:** Same colors represent same work modes across all charts
- **Accessibility:** Color-blind friendly palettes used
- **Meaning:** Green = positive, Red = negative (where applicable)

### 2. Labels & Annotations
- Clear axis labels with units
- Chart titles describe what is shown
- Key insights annotated directly on charts
- Legend placement optimized for readability

### 3. Scale Considerations
- Productivity: 0-10 scale for easy interpretation
- Wellbeing: 0-1 scale normalized
- Y-axis starts at zero to avoid visual distortion

### 4. Statistical Rigor
- Box plots show median, quartiles, and outliers
- Error bars/confidence intervals where appropriate
- Sample sizes displayed for transparency
