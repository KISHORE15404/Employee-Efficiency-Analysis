# 🏢Executive Summary

## 🎯Business Problem:

Organizations spend millions of dollars every year on workplace infrastructure but lack clear, data-driven insights on which work model — office, remote, or hybrid — truly optimizes both productivity and employee well-being. This project addresses the urgent need for actionable analytics to inform HR and leadership decisions in a changed, post-pandemic world.

## 🔍Key Findings:

**1. Office employees exhibit the highest productivity**

- Office: **4.32**

- Hybrid: **2.72**

- Remote: **1.14**

**2. Remote workers report the highest well-being**

- Remote: **0.62** vs. Office **0.58** and Hybrid **0.54**

**3. Remote/Hybrid work reduces infrastructure costs**

- Potential savings: **~$11,000 per employee/year (US)**

**4. Team Support influences outcomes more than location**

- Strong support = **0.70 wellbeing**

- Weak support = **0.44 wellbeing**

## 🧠What This Means:

There is no "perfect" model
| Work Mode | Strength | Risk |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 🏢 Office | Higher productivity | Lower wellbeing |
| 👩‍💻 Remote | Better wellbeing & cost savings | Lower productivity |
| 🔄 Hybrid | Balanced flexibility | Needs structured management |

## 🎯Recommendations:

- Optimize office footprint and invest savings from remote/hybrid models into employee support programs.

- Regularly collect and analyze employee data to monitor trends and adapt tactics.

- Focus on trust, clear communication, and equitable access to resources for all working groups.

## 📝Business Problem Statement

**"Organizations spend $X on workplace infrastructure but lack data-driven insights on which work model optimizes both productivity AND employee wellbeing."**

Despite substantial investments, most companies rely on guesswork and outdated assumptions when shaping workplace policies. The rise of hybrid and remote work offers cost and well-being benefits — but can also reduce productivity and engagement if not implemented strategically.

## 🧪Hypothesis

- **Primary:** Employees with more flexibility (hybrid or remote) will report greater well-being, but traditional office environments yield the highest measured productivity.

- **Secondary:** Departments with the strongest support structures, resources, and goal clarity will achieve better outcomes, regardless of work mode.

## 🔧Methodology

**1. Data Collection:**

- Surveyed 1,009 employees across 7 departments and 5 locations

- Used a structured questionnaire covering demographics, work configuration, productivity, wellbeing, support systems, and tools

**2. Data Cleaning:**

- Removed inconsistencies, standardized values, and handled missing entries

**3. Analysis:**

- Aggregated by work mode: "office", "hybrid", "remote"

- Statistical summary, group comparison (mean, std dev), and percentage differences

- Correlation, department, resource, and experience level analysis

- All results visualized in an interactive Streamlit dashboard

## 📌Key Findings

**1. Office Mode = Highest Productivity, Remote/Hybrid = Higher Wellbeing**

- **Office employees:** Avg. productivity score 4.32, wellbeing 0.58

- **Hybrid employees:** Prod. 2.72 (-37%), wellbeing 0.54 (-8%)

- **Remote employees:** Prod. 1.14 (-74%), wellbeing 0.62 (+6%)

**2. Team Support & Resources Matter**

- Employees with strong team support and access to resources/tools report much higher well-being (0.70 vs. 0.44 when support/resources are lacking)

**3. Financial Impact**

- Companies can save ~$11,000 per remote employee annually by reducing office-related expenses

- Hybrid work leads to office space savings of 10-50% depending on configuration

**4. Department & Experience Variation**

- QA, DevOps, and AI Engineer teams lead in productivity

- Well-being is not strictly tied to experience; all groups average around 0.57

## 🔄Business Recommendations

1. **Adopt a flexible, data-driven workplace policy** balancing office presence and remote days, customized by department/role.

2. **Invest in team support, resource access, and transparent communication** to maximize outcomes in all work modes.

3. **Reinvest office cost savings** from remote/hybrid arrangements into wellbeing programs, employee training, and workplace technology.

4. **Monitor and adapt** — regularly assess productivity and wellbeing to refine strategies and demonstrate ROI.

## ⚠️Limitations

**1. Self-reported data** may include subjective bias

**2. No longitudinal data** — unable to track productivity/well-being changes over time

**3. Limited to one organization/domain;** results may not generalize

**4. Did not include cohort/time series or more granular segmentation** (this is a recommended enhancement!)

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add cohort analysis (productivity by tenure), trend analysis, dynamic segmentation, and implement more interactive dashboard features.
